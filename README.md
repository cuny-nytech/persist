# Persistence assignment

## Description
App was conceived as simple Twitter clone. In fact functions as a message board where anyone can leave a message to Pedro (shorter than 140 characters).
Author of the message can be Anonymous and the last box is just to make spam messages harder, all you have to do is enter happy.

Messages are displayed from the most recent to the oldest.

There is option to tag message if you like it with thumbs up or thumbs down if you do not like it.

## Libraries used
Validation is done with parsley.js, DOM manipulation with jQuery there is also bootstrap because I am using font-awesome.

## Future Work
I wanted to include the option of user login, and full Twitter operations, like follwing users, public and anonyomous posts. That is for the future since I still have to learn how to deal with sessions and cookies in order to do user authentication in Sinatra.

===========

This repository creates a small web app that makes a small message board, like web app. 
That will take in posts from anyone. 
It is supposed to be a pretend watergate website for any famous person. 
IE you can pretend to be Obama, Whitney Houston's Ghost, Eisnten, a Kardashien, or etc and say whatever you want. 

I have a sample of the website which works which is here (https://sleepy-atoll-6973.herokuapp.com/), but im having problems with pg and the ruby parts of the website, and getting it to run locally
